  a.  Print out the value and determine the data type based on the value printed. <br>
  b.  Use the type function. <br>
  c.  Use it in a known equation and print the result. <br>
  d.  Look at the declaration of the variable. <br>

  c. Float <br>
  d. String <br>
  
  Your answer: d. 
  
_**3. Choose two built-in functions within Python that are not covered as examples in the Class02 outline.  Give a brief description of what the function does and provide an code example of how the function is called (you do not need to provide the result) (6 pts)**_ <br>

Function 1: Execute function --- exec() <br>
Description: Executes a created program <br>
Code Sample:<br>
```python
# program = a + b
exec(program)
```
Function 2: Power function--- pow() <br>

a. Fork<br>
b. Code Store<br>
c. Repository<br>
d. Organization<br>

_**5. Write a script that calls the Dissolve tool (the one in the Data Management toolbox) on a county boundaries shapefile using the "STATE" attribute as the dissolve field. The resulting shapefile should be named "states.shp" and multipart features should NOT be allowed. Show your syntax for the Dissolve geoprocessing tool within the starter code below.  You may use the "counties.shp" included in the Quiz01_counties.zip to test your script. (10 pts)**_ <br>

```python
import arcpy
path = r"C:\Users\aaron.g.anderson\Desktop\Quiz01_counties"

import arcpy
import os

arcpy.env.overwriteOutput = True

county_shp = r"counties.shp"


county_dissolve = arcpy.Dissolve_management(os.path.join(path, county_shp), os.path.join(path,"states.shp"),
                                             "SINGLE_PART")
 

```
